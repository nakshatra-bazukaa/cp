// What is game theory
    // Generally two players are playing a game
        // With logic we have to find who will win the game or conclusion
            // We will deal with Combinatrial Game theory
            // In this game will not stuck in a loop, it will eventually end
                // We will deal about two types of this 
                    // 1. Impartial Games
                    // 2. Partion Games 

// Game of nim:
    // P1, P2 {Two players playing the game optimally}
    // Nim Sum:
        // Xor of count of stones in each pile
    // If nim sum is
        // 0
            // P1 loses
        // Non zero
            // P1 wins
